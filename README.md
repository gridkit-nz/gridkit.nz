# Grid Kit

> Anyone can be a maker.

Grid Kit is a modular furniture system built around a precise 40 mm grid.  
It’s designed for people who value flexibility, repairability and simple materials — made from untreated New Zealand pine, easy to build with basic tools, and endlessly re-configurable.

## Why Grid Kit

Modern life changes fast — our furniture should keep up.  
Each Grid Kit component can be cut, reused or repurposed instead of discarded.  
It’s a toolkit for building shelves, benches, workstations, displays or whatever your space needs next.

### Core ideas
- **Modular 40 mm grid:** one system for many forms.  
- **Simple tools:** hand saw, hex key, and fasteners.  
- **Renewable material:** local untreated pine.  
- **Reuse over waste:** rebuild, don’t replace.

## How to Start

1. **Plan** — sketch a project or browse sample builds.  
2. **Gather** — order beams, panels and fasteners.  
3. **Build** — cut to size and assemble.  
4. **Adapt** — change or expand as your needs evolve.  

Guides and kits will return soon as we relaunch production.

## Sustainability

Grid Kit is part of a circular approach to living spaces —  
use local materials, design for disassembly, and keep every part in use as long as possible.

> Build once, rebuild forever.
